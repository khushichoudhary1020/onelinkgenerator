# Onelink

Onelink is a link-in-bio tool, where the data lives in the URL.

> **Note**
> Since the URL can become very long, it's better to use a link shortener like https://dub.co

Here's a demo page
(https://onelink-ner17clnd-khushis-projects-96096904.vercel.app/)

The data is converted to a base 64 string which we onelink uses as a query parameter. I have tried to reduce the json keys to be as small as possible

Roadmap.
1. Templates - make different templates, the `/1` after the host is basically a template here.
2. Refactor code - a lot of repeated boilerplate code is added here - refactor it properly.
